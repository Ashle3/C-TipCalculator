# C++ TipCalculator

# Overview

With this tip calculator, I am looking to expand my knowledge in the C++ language, which is a widely used language in the software development industry. By 
creating something as simple as a tip calculator, I am able to familiarize myself with the very basics of the C++ language, such as declaring variables, 
performing basic math operations, and printing/outputting information.

This program first asks you to enter a subtotal. After you enter it, the program then calculates the recommended tip (20% of your total) and displays it. 
The program then adds the tip to your subtotal, creating a new total that includes your subtotal and your recommended tip.

As mentioned above, my purpose for creating this software, was to familiarize myself with the C++ language, since it is so widely used. I figured something
as simple as a tip calculator would be enough to help me accomplish my learning goal.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop the software included Visual Studio, which I used to write and edit my code, and GitHub, which I used to save and upload
my code.

The main programming language that I used was C++. Besides using the input/output library (<iostream>), I also used the <iomanip> library, so that I could 
use the setprecision function to round calculated dollar amounts to two decimal places.

# Future Work

- Add a menu with prices so that the user can create a subtotal themselves
- Add a quantity feature so that you can get more than one of an item 
- After the tip is calculated, ask the user if they would like to customize/change their tip
